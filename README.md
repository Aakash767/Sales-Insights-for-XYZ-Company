# Sales-Insights-for-XYZ-Company

## Description of project
Sales Insights for XYZ Company is a Tableau dashboard that will give the entire company an overall view of the company's Sales and Profit performance. This project combines SQL data directly into Tableau so the dashboard can be accessed and viewed on any computer with Tableau runningâ€”without needing a live connection to the original database.

To facilitate analysis, critical SQL queries were applied to obtain and prepare required data. These queries aid in obtaining meaningful information and representing key business metrics effectively on the dashboard.
